# DubGProject
A multiplayer third-person shooter and battle arena action game that was created using Java. This project was made with Braydon Wang. It involved networking and used packets to communicate information between the server and multiple clients. Multiple players can join a game created by a single host. Players spawn on specific locations in a pre-generated map containing different types of terrain. Also, their are turrets (deadly) and boxes scattered around the map. Players can shoot boxes on the ground which drop random loot potions, which the players can pick up and consume. There are 4 types of potions: experience, health, rage, and speed potions. Experience potions give the players experience levels when consumed which then allow the players to upgrade into certain classes. There are 6 classes in the game following a pyramid structure: the sniper, marksman, shotgunner, rocketeer, dual wielder and gunner.
